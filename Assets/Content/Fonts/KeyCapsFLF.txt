The license holder Casady & Greene closed permanently in 2003. This font is 
used in good faith that this font is now available in the public domain. This 
seems confirmed by ex-employee comments here:

On July 3, 2003, Casady&Greene closed it doors permanently. However, one of 
its designers, Mike Wright, writes: I believe that all the fonts that were 
developed by the company are now in the public domain. Robin Casady and I 
are thinking of putting up a site with free downloads of all of the old C&G 
public domain fonts--mainly as a way of attracting Mac users to see iData 2."

The font used in Tabletop Theatre is KeyCapsFLF_edited.ttf, which is the
original font with a few missing glyphs added by Robert van Kooten for
Tabletop Theatre. This remains in the public domain together with the original.
